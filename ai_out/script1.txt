To accomplish this task, we need to split the large file into smaller parts, sort each part individually, and then merge the sorted parts into a single sorted file. This approach is useful when dealing with large files that cannot fit into memory.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Split the large file into smaller parts using the `split` command.
2. Sort each part individually using the `sort` command.
3. Merge the sorted parts into a single sorted file using the `sort -m` command.

</summary>
<command>split, sort, sort -m</command>
<filename>split_sort_merge.sh</filename>
<content>#! /bin/bash

# Set the number of lines per split file
LINES_PER_FILE=1000

# Split the large file into smaller parts
split -l $LINES_PER_FILE large_file.txt part_

# Sort each part individually
for file in part_*; do
  sort $file > sorted_$file
done

# Merge the sorted parts into a single sorted file
sort -m sorted_part_* > sorted_large_file.txt

# Remove temporary files
rm part_* sorted_part_*
</content>

### Alternative Solution

If you want to avoid creating temporary files, you can use the following script:

<filename>split_sort_merge_pipe.sh</filename>
<content>#! /bin/bash

# Set the number of lines per split file
LINES_PER_FILE=1000

# Split the large file into smaller parts, sort each part, and merge the sorted parts
split -l $LINES_PER_FILE large_file.txt part_ | while read file; do
  sort $file
done | sort -m > sorted_large_file.txt
</content>

Note: This alternative solution uses a pipe to avoid creating temporary files, but it may not be suitable for very large files due to the limitations of the pipe buffer size.
